# PO.DAAC-Cloud-Early-Adopters-Documentation
This repo hosts documentation for the **PO.DAAC Cloud Early Adopters Program**, including telecon presentations, meeting notes, Terms of Reference, reports, etc.

## What is PO.DAAC

The [PO.DAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/) (Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center) is an element of the Earth Observing System Data and Information System ([EOSDIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/)). The EOSDIS provides science data to a wide community of users for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. PO.DAAC is hosted at NASA's JPL. PO.DAAC has become the premier data center for measurements focused on ocean surface topography (OST), sea surface temperature (SST), ocean winds, sea surface salinity (SSS), gravity, ocean circulation and sea ice.

## What is the PO.DAAC Cloud Early Adopters Program

An effort by the PO.DAAC to ensure PO.DAAC and EOSDIS provided cloud-based data and services meet the greater user community's expectations and needs as it adopts the cloud as a platform for Earth data use. Read more on [EOSDIS's](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/cloud-evolution) evolution to the cloud.

**Goals** for the PO.DAAC Cloud Early Adopters Program

1. Support the development of appropriate PO.DAAC cloud-based services for use and adoption by the ocean, hydrology, and coastal science and applications communities.
2. Support the user community in the adoption and use of PO.DAAC cloud-based data holdings and services.
3. Expand the PO.DAAC user community through fostering a (SWOT-user) community that is ready to adopt Cloud Computing when using Earth data; and through relationship development with the hydrology community, which is a new user community for PO.DAAC.

For more details on the program, including roles and responsabilities of the Early Adopters (EAs) and the PO.DAAC, please read the *Terms of Reference* document available in this repo.
